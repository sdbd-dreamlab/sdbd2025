# Small Data, Big Dreams

A repo to generate a free and simple digital collection site using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [CollectionBuilder](collectionbuilder.github.io).

Visit the [site](https://sdbd-dreamlab.github.io/sdbd2025/). This repo was used for Small Data, Big Dreams: Minimal Computing for Data Collection & Visualization at [DREAM Lab 2025](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/dream-lab/small-data-big-dreams-2025/)

## About the Data 

## Build a Digital Collection

Gather your digital objects together and create your metadata using the [CollectionBuilder-GH Metadata Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Uv9ytll0hysMOH1j-VL1lZx6PWvc1zf3L35sK_4IuzI/copy) and [metadata docs](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/metadata/gh_metadata/). 

Then click the green "use this template" button to create your repository, and add your metadata and configure the repository to fit your collection and settings following the [CollectionBuilder Docs](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/). 

Please feel free to ask questions in the main [CollectionBuilder discussion forum](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder.github.io/discussions).

**Note:** 
Since CollectionBuilder-GH uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), it is only suitable for small collections, with lower resolution images. 
GitHub repositories are limited to 1GB.
For larger collections or those that require more customization, check out the [CollectionBuilder-CSV](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-csv) template.

## CollectionBuilder 

<https://collectionbuilder.github.io/>

CollectionBuilder is a project of University of Idaho Library's [Digital Initiatives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/) and the [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu) (CDIL) following the [Lib-Static](https://lib-static.github.io/) methodology. 
Powered by the open source static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and a modern static web stack, it puts collection metadata to work building beautiful sites.

The basic theme is created using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
Metadata visualizations are built using open source libraries such as [DataTables](https://datatables.net/), [Leafletjs](http://leafletjs.com/), [Spotlight gallery](https://github.com/nextapps-de/spotlight), [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes), and [Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/).
Object metadata is exposed using [Schema.org](http://schema.org) and [Open Graph protocol](http://ogp.me/) standards.
